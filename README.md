# Player-Perfrormance-Analysis

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to identify the best five starting players for the Chicago Bulls based on their performance in the 2018-19 NBA season. We have been given a budget of $118 million for player contracts for the next season (2019-20), which ranks 26th out of 30 teams in the league.

The analysis will involve evaluating the performance metrics and salaries of the players from the 2018-19 season to determine the most valuable players within our budget. The analysis will consider players from different positions to form a balanced starting lineup.

## Project Structure
The project will be organized as follows:

### Data Collection: We will gather the necessary data, including player performance statistics and salary information for the 2018-19 season. This data will be obtained from reliable sources such as NBA official records and reputable sports databases.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and eliminate any inconsistencies or missing values. This step will involve data cleaning, handling outliers, and merging datasets if necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis: We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the player performance metrics and identify any trends or patterns. This analysis will involve visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution of player statistics and their impact on team performance.

### Player Selection: Based on the analysis conducted, we will select the best five starting players for the Chicago Bulls. These players will be chosen considering their performance, position, salary, and the team's budget constraints.

### Documentation: We will create a knitr report using R Markdown to document the entire analysis process, including data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, player selection, and any key findings or recommendations.
